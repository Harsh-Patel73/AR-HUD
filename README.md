# AR-HUD

The project was built on the Unity Game Engine using C# and is intended to be run on the Oculus Quest 2 device to view augmented reality capabilities. This project is meant to demonstrate the functions of the algorithm, design of the display, and features of the warning system. Some portions of the code are hard-coded for demonstration purposes.
